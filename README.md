In this first project, I want to show how we can deploy a node.js application with EC2 and a AWS MySQL Data base.
So I first create the Database instance, and then use a tool like Mysql Worbench to create the Data Base and Tables, I then use Postman to query the database.
All routes (GET,POST,DELETE, UPDATE) are created in app.js
